                    Our classes have a low teacher to student ratio which gives the students ample attention from the 
                    teachers so that they are led to expolite their true potential and become the best they can be. 
                    This close attention ensures that students who require special attention to understand their 
                    academics get the needed assistance to enable them move with the rest.
